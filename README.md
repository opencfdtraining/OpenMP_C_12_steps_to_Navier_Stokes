# OpenMP/C 12 steps to Navier Stokes
Parallelization attempt to the “12 steps to Navier–Stokes” lessons using OpenMP/C
The lectures were used in the classroom as part of a university course for four years in a row (Boston University, 2009 to 2013), taught by by Prof. Barba. The codes for the lectures were written in Python language. In this project C language has been used to write the CFD programs. An attempt to parallelize the codes using OpenMP has been made.
